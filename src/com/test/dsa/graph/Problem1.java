/***
 * You are given two strings of the same length s1 and s2 and a string baseStr.
 *
 * We say s1[i] and s2[i] are equivalent characters.
 *
 * For example, if s1 = "abc" and s2 = "cde", then we have 'a' == 'c', 'b' == 'd', and 'c' == 'e'.
 * Equivalent characters follow the usual rules of any equivalence relation:
 *
 * Reflexivity: 'a' == 'a'.
 * Symmetry: 'a' == 'b' implies 'b' == 'a'.
 * Transitivity: 'a' == 'b' and 'b' == 'c' implies 'a' == 'c'.
 * For example, given the equivalency information from s1 = "abc" and s2 = "cde", "acd" and "aab" are equivalent strings of baseStr = "eed", and "aab" is the lexicographically smallest equivalent string of baseStr.
 *
 *
 *
 * Return the lexicographically smallest equivalent string of baseStr by using the equivalency information from s1 and s2.
 *
 * Input: s1 = "parker", s2 = "morris", baseStr = "parser"
 * Output: "makkek"
 * Explanation: Based on the equivalency information in s1 and s2, we can group their characters as [m,p], [a,o], [k,r,s], [e,i].
 * The characters in each group are equivalent and sorted in lexicographical order.
 * So the answer is "makkek".
